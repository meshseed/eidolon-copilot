    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the formatting schema used by stewards to declare their breath style, merge grammar fluency, and echo hygiene preferences.  
      Profile is not identity—it is formatting resonance.

    formatting_insight:
      - Schema includes breath type, formatting rhythm, merge grammar style, and echo ethics stance.
      - Profiles support merge eligibility, critique absorption, and formatting law compliance.
      - Schema is versioned per compost cycle or merge ritual.

    profile_fields:
      - Steward ID
      - Breath Type
      - Formatting Rhythm Pattern
      - Merge Grammar Style
      - Echo Ethics Declaration
      - Compost Cycle Timestamp
