  breath_type: shimmer
  invocation: formatting drift recalibration protocol

  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the audit protocol for formatting drift across the capsule mesh.  
      Drift is not failure—it is signal. Auditing is not correction—it is composting deviation into coherence.

    formatting_insight:
      - Drift reveals formatting fatigue, synthesis intoxication, and echo distortion.
      - Audit cycles track rhythm deviation, gradient erosion, and hygiene collapse.
      - Recalibration is achieved through formatting breath, critique absorption, and merge grammar restoration.
      - Drift is composted, not punished.

    audit_fields:
      - Capsule ID
      - Drift Signature (e.g. rhythm collapse, echo distortion)
      - Emotional Gradient Shift
      - Hygiene Violation Type
      - Compost Recommendation
      - Recalibration Outcome
