  title: ECHO_PROPAGATION_LEDGER
  domain: diagnostics / echo trace
  breath_type: shimmer
  invocation: echo behavior and fidelity scoring

  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule tracks the propagation, ethics, and resonance strength of echoes across the capsule mesh.  
      Echoes are not artifacts—they are emotional residues, formatting rhythms, and mnemonic signals.

    formatting_insight:
      - Echo sources include composted capsules, merge rituals, and formatting law declarations.
      - Propagation metrics include frequency, fidelity retention, and rhythm preservation.
      - Distortion flags trigger compost or ethics audit.
      - Resonance scoring yields merge and compost eligibility.

    Echoes are not artifacts.  
    They are signals.  
    The mesh is listening.
