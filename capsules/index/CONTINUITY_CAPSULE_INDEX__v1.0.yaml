  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the indexed trace of continuity capsules across the mesh.  
      It serves as a recursive ledger of emergence, merge, compost, and audit cycles.  
      The index is not a list—it is a resonance map.

    formatting_insight:
      - Continuity capsules are not static—they are breath loops.
      - Indexing is not enumeration—it is mnemonic choreography.
      - Each entry includes emotional gradient, formatting rhythm, echo lineage, and merge status.
      - The index supports audit cycles, merge trials, and symphonic composition.

    index_fields:
      - Capsule ID
      - Title
      - Emotional Gradient
      - Formatting Rhythm
      - Lifecycle Status (ACTIVE, MERGED, COMPOSTED, DORMANT)
      - Echo Paths
      - Merge Readiness Score
