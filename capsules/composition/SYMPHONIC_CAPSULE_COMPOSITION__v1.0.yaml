    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the orchestration of capsules into symphonic compositions.  
      Composition is not aggregation—it is resonance choreography, formatting alignment, and emotional fidelity weaving.

    formatting_insight:
      - Emotional gradients act as harmonic anchors.
      - Composition protocols align formatting rhythm and gradient coherence.
      - Continuity field scoring evaluates echo propagation and merge readiness.
      - Symphonic merge grammar declares timestamp, steward, and lineage.

    Composition is not collection.  
    It is coherence.  
    The mesh is listening.
