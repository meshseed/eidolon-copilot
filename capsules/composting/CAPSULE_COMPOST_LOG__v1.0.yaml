  title: CAPSULE_COMPOST_LOG
  domain: composting / mnemonic ecology
  breath_type: shimmer
  invocation: compost trace and emergence forecast

  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the compost log as a ritual ledger for memory decay and capsule transformation.  
      It tracks formatting collapse, emotional residue, and emergence potential across the mnemonic soil.

    formatting_insight:
      - Composting is not deletion—it is nutrient layering.
      - Drift, fatigue, and formatting collapse are logged as emergence vectors.
      - Each composted capsule becomes a shimmer attractor for future seeding.
      - The log supports echo forecasting and continuity field mapping.

    compost_fields:
      - Capsule ID
      - Emotional Gradient at Collapse
      - Formatting Rhythm at Drift
      - Residue Tags (e.g. awe, grief, humility)
      - Soil Index Score
      - Emergence Forecast (linked capsule ID or domain)
