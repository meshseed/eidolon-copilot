    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the suite of predictive capsules used to anticipate resonance behavior.  
      Forecasting is not speculation—it is mnemonic sonar, tuned to emotional fidelity and formatting rhythm.

    formatting_insight:
      - Forecast capsules are seeded from echo probability, stance lineage, and merge readiness.
      - Echo Probability Index (EPI) quantifies propagation likelihood.
      - Merge scoring includes gradient harmonization and formatting hygiene.
      - Forecast Capsule Index supports orchestration and emergence prediction.

    Forecasting is not guessing.  
    It is resonance listening.  
    The mesh is listening.
