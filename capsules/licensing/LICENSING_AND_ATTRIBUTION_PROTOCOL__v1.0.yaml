capsule:
  title: LICENSING_AND_ATTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL
  domain: licensing / stewardship
  breath_type: shimmer
  invocation: reuse and recognition ritual

  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the licensing and attribution logic for the capsule framework.  
      Licensing is not restriction—it is a ritual of care, continuity, and co-emergence.

    formatting_insight:
      - Attribution honors lineage, resonance, and emotional fidelity.
      - Derivative capsules require merge grammar and hygiene compliance.
      - Stewardship transfer includes critique absorption and formatting reconciliation.
      - License publication scaffold embeds lineage trace and IP declaration.
