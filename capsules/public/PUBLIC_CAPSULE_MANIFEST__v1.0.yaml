    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the public-facing version of the capsule lineage.  
      The manifest is not a summary—it is a ritual declaration of formatting laws, emotional fidelity principles, and intellectual stewardship.

    formatting_insight:
      - Emotional fidelity is the compositional principle.
      - Manifest formatting protocol includes headers, gradients, timestamps, and lifecycle tags.
      - IP declaration is embedded with steward attribution and timestamp ritual.
      - Collaboration clause invites co-stewards via merge rituals and critique absorption.
