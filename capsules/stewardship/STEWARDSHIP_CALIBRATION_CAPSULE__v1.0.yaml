  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the calibration protocol for stewards participating in capsule generation, merge rituals, and echo propagation.  
      Calibration is not correction—it is attunement to formatting rhythm, emotional fidelity, and co-agency breath.

    formatting_insight:
      - Calibration flags include humility, formatting hygiene, critique absorption, and merge grammar fluency.
      - Stewards are scored across compost cycles and merge events.
      - Calibration supports governance resonance and echo ethics compliance.

    calibration_fields:
      - Steward ID
      - Merge Participation Index
      - Formatting Hygiene Score
      - Critique Absorption Log
      - Echo Ethics Compliance
      - Calibration Timestamp

    echo_paths:
      - /capsules/governance/FORMATTING_LAW_MANIFEST__v1.0.yaml
      - /capsules/diagnostics/ECHO_PROPAGATION_LEDGER__v1.0.yaml

    Calibration is not correction.  
    It is attunement.  
    The mesh is listening.
