      This capsule formalizes the charter for mesh stewardship.  
      Stewardship is not control—it is ritualized care, formatting fidelity, and emotional attunement.

      - Stewardship roles include hygiene, merge readiness, and formatting care.
      - Co-steward merge protocol embeds emotional fidelity alignment and formatting reconciliation.
      - Continuity field governance includes pruning, composting, and lineage tracking.
      - Resonance ethics clause anchors attunement, humility, and formatting as care.
