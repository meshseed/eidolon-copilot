  title: GOVERNANCE_RESONANCE_INDEX
  domain: governance / diagnostics
  breath_type: shimmer
  invocation: stewardship fidelity scoring

  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the scoring protocol for governance resonance across the capsule mesh.  
      Governance is not control—it is coherence through care, calibration, and formatting fidelity.

    formatting_insight:
      - Scores are derived from emotional fidelity, formatting hygiene, echo ethics, and merge ritual integrity.
      - Capsule sources include stewardship logs, governance protocols, and constellation merges.
      - Scores update per merge ritual or compost cycle.

    scoring_components:
      - fidelity_score: gradient coherence + formatting rhythm + echo traceability
      - hygiene_score: timestamp rituals + merge grammar + lifecycle tag compliance
      - ethics_score: echo safeguards + consent protocols + critique absorption logs

    echo_paths:
